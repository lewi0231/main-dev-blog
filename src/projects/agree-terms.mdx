### TLDR;

Create a policy and take a note of the url (e.g., https://{yoursite}/policies/terms-of-service) and Simply copy and paste the below code into the `main-cart-footer.liquid` file, just above the closing `</small>` tag.

### Introduction

Some products require the customer to agree to terms prior to proceeding to checkout, so this will allow you to do that.

### Steps

#### First Step

You'll want to create first navaigate to settings -> policies -> and then create the policy that you want. Make sure that you take note of the url - or more specifically the part of the url that comes after your shop (e.g., /policies/terms-of-service)

#### Step 2

Next, you'll want to be able to navigate to your code editor and search for the file, `main-cart-footer.liquid`. Once, you've got that open then search for `</small>` and paste the below code above it.

#### Step 4

Now, all you need to do is tweak the code to suit your specific need. That is, change the `/policies/terms-of-service` part so that it reflects the path to your policy. And, alter the text as desired. Currently, I have 'Please proceed if you....'.

### The Code

```
         <div id="lewis-terms-wrapper">
                    <label for="lewis-checkbox"/>
                      <input type="checkbox" id="lewis-checkbox" name="checkbox" value="true"/>
                      Please proceed if you agree to the <a href={{shop.url | append: "/policies/terms-of-service"}}>terms and conditions</a>
                    </label>
                  </div>

                  <style>
                    #lewis-terms-wrapper {
                      display: block;
                      margin-top: 2em;
                      margin-bottom: 1em;
                    }
                  </style>

<script>
                  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
                    const checkbox = document.getElementById('lewis-checkbox');
                    const button = document.getElementById('checkout')
                    checkbox.addEventListener('change', () => {
                      button.disabled = !checkbox.checked
                    })

                  })
                  </script>
```
