### TL;DR

### Introduction

You might have looked upon this effect (see below image) in other Shopify websites, with longing.  This is a relatively easy change, using Shopify's Custom CSS block.

### Step-By-Step

1. Place your Collection List Section where you would like it.

2. Click on the Collection List Section to access the settings in the Theme editor.

3. Paste the below code in the Custom CSS block, down the bottom.

```
.card__content {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0;
  top: 45%;
  transition: all 1s ease;
}
.card-wrapper .card__media {
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
.card-wrapper:hover .card__media {
  opacity: 0.3;
}
.card-wrapper:hover .card__content {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
.card__content h3 {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
.card__content svg {
  width: 1em;
}
```

### Explanation

The above code takes the `card__content`, which is the `h3` link content and positions it 45% from the top of its parent container.  Hover effects and sizing have been altered for aesthetics.
