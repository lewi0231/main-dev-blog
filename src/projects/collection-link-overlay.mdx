#### TL;DR
Create a text-hover-overlay on the Collection List section via adding css to its Custom CSS block.

#### Introduction

You might have looked upon this effect (see below image) in other Shopify websites, with longing.  This is a relatively easy change, using Shopify's Custom CSS block.

#### Step-By-Step

##### 1. Add the Collection List section
Place your Collection List Section where you would like it.

##### 2. Access Collection List settings
Click on the Collection List Section to access the settings in the Theme editor.

##### 3. Create a Custom Liquid block
Paste the below code in the Custom CSS block, down the bottom.

```CSS
.card__content {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0;
  top: 45%;
  transition: all 1s ease;
}
.card-wrapper .card__media {
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}
.card-wrapper:hover .card__media {
  opacity: 0.3;
}
.card-wrapper:hover .card__content {
  opacity: 0.8;
}
.card__content h3 {
  font-size: 3rem;
}
.card__content svg {
  width: 1em;
}
```

#### Explanation

The above code takes the `card__content`, which is the `h3` link content and positions it 45% from the top of its parent container.  Hover effects and sizing have been altered for aesthetics.
