            <p>
                Hi! I transitioned into software engineering after a fulfilling career in human services. This journey was driven by my passion for technology and creation. I cherish the collaborative experiences and skills gained from developing RESTful APIs, conducting performance testing, and working on front-end development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've embraced freelancing to align with my love for flexibility and creativity. It's a path that allows me to engage deeply with each project and continuously explore new challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                Outside of coding, I'm inspired by nature and music, which influence my approach to technology â€“ thoughtful, user-centric, and innovative.
